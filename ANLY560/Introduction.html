        <strong><font color=#3c096c>Brief introduction: </strong></font> <br>
        
          <p>House is an indispensable consumer product in residents' life. Whether renting or buying, each of us needs a place to live. Therefore, it is very necessary to conduct research on the real estate market. In recent years, the development of China's real estate industry has shown a positive trend, which is inseparable from the development of China's overall economy. On the one hand, with the acceleration of urbanization in China, more and more rural population is moving to cities, which undoubtedly creates a huge demand for housing. On the other hand, the house is also a relatively stable investment target that many people will choose. </p>
          
          <p>However, in recent years, due to the influence of COVID-19 and other factors, the overall development trend of China's real estate industry has changed. What is the reason why house prices have changed from high-speed growth to stable. The reason for this situation may be due to the saturation of demand (population structure problem) on the one hand, and the regulation and control of macro policies on the other hand (Houses are used to live in, not to generate economic benefits - to protect the basic interests of ordinary residents). </p>

          <p>Therefore, we believe that in order to achieve better development under the current conditions, real estate enterprises should not only comply with the guidance of national policies, but also actively look for new opportunities and find new opportunities in the existing environment. How to connect traditional industries with modern technology, how to use modern technology to expand and discover people's new needs and create new business opportunities are the key points that should be considered at present. </p>

          <p>To sum up, our topic hopes to investigate the development of China's real estate industry from the perspective of time series, in order to grasp the development trend of the real estate industry in the next ten years. For this purpose, we will collect data and conduct comprehensive research from three aspects: the historical stock price trend of companies in the real estate industry, the historical trend of macroeconomic indicators in the same period, and major events in the same period (news and public opinion / macropolicy). At the same time, the 10 questions listed below can help you to deeply understand the content of our topic, and we also hope that our project will give you some inspiration. </p>

        <strong>What we will explore: </strong>
        <br><br>
        <p>So before you start browsing our projects, if you are interested, you can also think about the following questions in advance to see if your current views are consistent with the ideas you have after reading our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q1: Looking for the link between the development of the China's real estate industry and China's macroeconomic situation (resident income / GDP)? <br>
            Q2: Looking for the relationship between the development of the China's real estate industry and other industries (through the comparison between the real estate industry index and the market index)? <br>
            Q3: Looking for the relationship between the development of the China's real estate industry and the change of China's population structure (including floating population data)? <br>
            Q4: Is the development of the real estate industry cyclical (analyze the development process of China's real estate market from the fluctuation of stock prices of Listed Companies in the real estate industry in recent years - discuss the factors accompanying the important development stage of China's real estate market)? <br>
            Q5: Is there any similarity in the stock price fluctuations of China's real estate companies with different market values (from the perspective of the company's main business)? <br>
            Q6: Is there any difference in the growth trend of China's house prices in different cities (analyze the possible reasons for the difference)? <br>
            Q7: Is there a relationship between the development of real estate enterprises and national policies (supervision / loan policy / tax policy / benchmark interest rate)? <br>
            Q8: Is there a significant correlation between house prices and public opinion (news public opinion / mainstream social media and other platform content)? <br>
            Q9: Impact of major events on the development of the real estate industry in the short term: epidemic situation? <br>
            Q10: What are the opportunities for the future development of the real estate industry? How to discover and create new needs? How to transform and upgrade the industry? (digital transformation, combined with other needs of residents: culture, tourism and health care) <br>
